# Here is online test in 20181206

## Question 1

the first question, in the folder `lessSandBox`
there are three files,

- index.html
- less
  - style.css
  - style.less

I write the code in the style.less can compile it with `lessc style.less style.css` to get the css answer in style.css file. And copy the context in style.css and paste it inside the index.html `<style>` tag.

What I write in less file is ,to set the different color to different part of `<div>`, there are four div, so there are four different colors.

To position the div, using `float:left` and make each div take the half width of the windows, 1/4 height of the windows.

What I have done for Q2 is ,to fetch data from JSON file and display each content in one div box with something like

```
============
'Author Name'

```

Using the example carousel code from W3cSchool the open source, and dispay the date in each carousel.

next step, adjust the css style to make the project looks good.
