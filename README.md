## Question 1

the first question
there are three files,

- index.html
- less
  - style.css
  - style.less

I write the code in the style.less can compile it with `lessc style.less style.css` to get the css answer in style.css file. And copy the context in style.css and paste it inside the index.html `<style>` tag.

What I write in less file is ,to set the different color to different part of `<div>`, there are four div, so there are four different colors.

To position the div, using `float:left` and make each div take the half width of the windows, 1/4 height of the windows.
